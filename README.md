# Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3

[This is link](http://zonghm.github.io/01-ghd3/index.html) to index.html

I reference the link https://www.dashingd3js.com/svg-basic-shapes-and-d3js. I created a train with a box using different colors and all the shapes that required. A screen shot is included in the submission. This is my first time code in js.
